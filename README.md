# CocoaPods Azure Universal Packages plugin

This project is a [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) plugin that allows to dowload pods published as [Universal Packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/quickstarts/universal-packages) in [Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/artifacts/) feeds.

## Getting started

Install the plugin by adding to your `Gemfile`
```Ruby
gem "cocoapods-azure-universal-packages"
```

Under the hood the plugin uses the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/azcli) to download the Universal Packages, you can install it running
```shell
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

Finally, ensure that you are logged in using
```shell
az login
```

## How it works

The plugin replaces the default CocoaPods HTTP downloader when a pod source URL points to a universal package and it uses the Azure CLI to perform the download.

_Note:_ The plugin will install the Azure CLI [DevOps extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devops-cli-extension) automatically when running `pod install` or `pod update` for the first time.

## Usage

Add to your Podfile
```Ruby
plugin 'cocoapods-azure-universal-packages', {
    :base_url => '{{BASE_URL}}'
}
```
replacing `{{BASE_URL}}` with the base URL of your Azure Artifacts feed (for example, `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/`).

Then, in your podspec set the pod's source to
```Ruby
# For project scoped feeds:
spec.source = { :http => '{{BASE_URL}}/{{ORGANIZATION}}/{{PROJECT}}/_apis/packaging/feeds/{{FEED}}/upack/packages/{{PACKAGE}}/versions/{{VERSION}}' }

# For organization scoped feeds:
spec.source = { :http => '{{BASE_URL}}/{{ORGANIZATION}}/_apis/packaging/feeds/{{FEED}}/upack/packages/{{PACKAGE}}/versions/{{VERSION}}' }
```
where:
- `{{BASE_URL}}` is the base URL you chose above
- `{{ORGANIZATION}}` is the name of your feed's organization
- `{{PROJECT}}` is the name of your feed's project (you must specify this only if your feed is a project scoped feed)
- `{{PACKAGE}}` is the name of your universal package
- `{{VERSION}}` is the version of your universal package
